 Pure HTML CSS JS templates

## Here is **VE**ry **LI**ght **TE**mplates **FO**r **LA**ndings.

main.css file in the core is my best to keep this light and ready for adaptiveness without any libs, compillers. But... Ok, `normalize.css` is inside, yeah. 
Just replace empty one in the template by mentioned, if you wanna try.
Sure, it is absolutely customisable, get parts from it, even  perform all from scratch. 
Good luck in coding.
