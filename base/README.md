 Pure HTML CSS JS template

## Wellcome into **VE**ry **LI**ght **TE**mplate **FO**r **LA**nding.

* Pure and light template for programmers, who has knowlege about HTML+CSS+JS. There is no compillers, SCSS, PUG, etc, hovewer component approach based on Web Components standart.
* main.css file in the core is my best to keep light, well commented and ready for adaptiveness without any libs, compillers. Well, `normalize.css` is included.
* Try to keep this adaptive. 
Good luck. 

### Folder structure

* The folders 'base' and 'demo' considered as cores. To obtain proper work You need run server directly from these foldrers; 
* base is scratch template. Alternatively it's an empty project, you can modify any way you like; 
* To review complete version, copy and start on the local server 'demo' folder;
* 'Components' folder includes some ready components, sections, items, etc. to insert in a project or supersede existed items instead;
